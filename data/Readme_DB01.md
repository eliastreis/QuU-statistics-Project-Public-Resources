For the "DB01_gaming_video_quality" dataset, two within-subject design tests were conducted in the lab environment of TUB. 

For "Study 1", the games 1, 2, and 3 were used. All participants rated all 72 conditions.

The design design followed the ITU-T Rec. P.809.

The conditions are various encoding settings for which video scenes were encoded and shown to the participants who then rated the video quality and underlying dimensions following ITU-T Rec. P.918.

Independent variables:
Game: (1, 2, 3) , (4, 5 ,6)
Resolution: 480p, 720p, 1080p
Framerate: 30 fps, 60 fps
Bitrate [kbps]: depends on resolution! (300 to 50000)

Dependent variables:
VQ	Overall Video Quality
VF	Video Fragmentation
VU	Video Unclearness
VD	Video Discontinuity
VL	Video Luminosity
AC	Acceptance

Rating Scale:
7-point extended continous (see ITU-T Recs.)
